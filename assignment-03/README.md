# Assignment 03
## Kyle Kredo

1. This assignment was a bit more of a struggle than the last two. It reminded me of last semester in MART120 and some of the nightmares I went through with the functions. I was able to change the font and colors just fine with an external CSS sheet and understood the first two choices and their structure. Where things got tricky for me and I could not get to work was making the new choices appear. Specifically speaking I have the first choice of whether to go left or right. Fine. Then left takes you to a bear and I give the choice of running away or continuing. Fine. Then I got stuck. I then have choices depending on whether you run or continue. These show up but the user is unable to answer, it says "invalid." I also struggled with making the images show up. I got the main one to show, but the photos for the choices would not. I think this might have to do with the CSS? Overall this was a good refresher with JavaScript, but I am going to have to put in some work to get comfortable with it.
