# Assignment 10
## Kyle Kredo

 This was a big challenge for me. I did not complete much of the assignment and struggled to complete very simple tasks within. Getting the squares to appear was really difficult, and getting two was very hard. I am not sure why, I think I am overthinking alot of this. I had to do a little bit of internet searching to figure out how to make my squares move, but even that is not done properly. I have both squares by entering any letter key and they only move right. I am not sure why my WASD controls will not work. I am thinking that the squares have to put into something separate like a class and in that class I can say something like "square1 +5" or something like that. I am not sure how I would get them to move left / right. Maybe simply "left" but I am not sure, I will have to try it. The music addition was also a struggle, which I then learned I simply had been calling the wrong item from my folder.


Michael helped me out a lot and fixed my code so that the square moved properly. Really appreciate his guidance!
