# Assignment 01

1. This assignment was not too bad. I was able to recycle code from various other
assignments of last semester and mold them into a working site. I struggled with
the sizing of the images and had to downsize them in Photoshop. I still feel that
they are a bit big, but I like the large filling look on my screen. This assignment was a good rust buster after not working with HTML for about a month.
I was not sure if I wanted to make the site a single page or three pages, but I settled with three because I felt that it looked more professional and flowed better. Three pages also allowed me to showcase more of my work in a less overwhelming manner. Making the navigation bar was a bit tricky to get. I have done them before, but the styling got a little tricky. I had to adjust the padding and width a bit. I also added some social media icons to make the pages look more realistic. I think it would be cool to learn how to actually link these icons to their respective sites. I am sure its simple, just have not looked into it yet. I am beginning to develop a sense of style in web design, mostly inspired from my favorite clothing brands. Visuals are the key with photography taking the majority of the screen with simple fonts and colors. Visuals are the focus, everything else is there to compliment it. I am looking forward to learning more skills in web design so I can further develop my own style.
