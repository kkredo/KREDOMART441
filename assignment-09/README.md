# Assignment 09
## Kyle Kredo

What a crazy time we are living in. This is truly historic and something that we will talk about for years to come. With all of this uncertainty things have been difficult to focus on. The last week and a half I was trying to figure out what would be best to do in terms of going back home or remaining in Missoula. I did not have the time I would have liked to give this assignment. I used alot of the example code heavily to help me understand what things need to look like and how they interact with eachother. I made lots of simple syntak errors but they helped me understand how important a simple / or , could be. I think it is cool how JSON can store data separately. I believe this would be extremely helpful when working with large data sets. I found some of the scripts to be a little daunting and struggled to understand how each of them are related. But if I am assuming correctly, the JSON stores info, the AJAX calls or retrieves it and the main JS kind of sets up what we will actually see.
