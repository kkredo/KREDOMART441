# Assignment 04
## Kyle Kredo

1. What a time. This assignment took much longer than I would like to admit, but I walk away with a much better understanding of how functions and if else statements work. Before they never really made sense to me and I did not understand calling on functions and writing if else statements. I went through a lot of trial and error and would make a few squares worth of progress only to go back several. I had to ask for a lot of help, which really solidified the information. I struggled mostly with understanding how the statements related to each other. Like by having questions and writing a statement that would call that function. It is so clear now, but at the beginning it was very overwhelming and I did know how to break it down. The biggest takeaway from this week was that I have to take a second and think about how things relate to each other, not as a whole. I found myself getting too caught up in why things that worked in other statements did not work rather than looking at the individual statement.
