# Assignment 05
## Kyle Kredo

This week was rough. Very sick and very busy, had little time to get to this assignment unfortunately. I struggled alot with the arrays and still have a hard time understanding them. I will have to look at this assignment again and give it more time to learn the material. I am pretty sure I had to create a ton of arrays on my own for this work properly such as the flip images and print blanks. Those came up alot in my console log saying that they were not defined. I will have to add those. Feel terrible, can barely focus. Will get at this again this upcoming week.


Got help from Michael, he really cleared some things up! Got the game to work!
