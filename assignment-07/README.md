# Assignment 07
## Kyle Kredo

This one was a little trickier but I enjoyed it. I had to have Michael help me to get my images appear as well as constructing my arrays correctly. I learned alot this week about the uses of arrays and how they really can store information that other wise would be single variables. I was unable to get my random array to work let alone build it. I ran out of time but I will revisit it soon. Enjoyed this one.
